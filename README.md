This Java program simulates an ATM system with a User class and ATM class. The User class is designed to represent a bank user with attributes such as card number, PIN, name, and balance. Predefined users with specific card numbers, names, and initial balances are created.

The ATM class provides methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. The deposit method allows users to add funds to their account, and the withdraw method enables users to take out money if their balance is sufficient. The checkBalance method displays the current balance of the user.

The process method orchestrates user interactions with the ATM, prompting them to choose between depositing, withdrawing, or checking their balance. The main method acts as the entry point, prompting users to input their card number and PIN. If the PIN is correct, users can proceed to perform ATM operations.

The program supports multiple transactions, looping until the user decides to exit. It offers a basic but functional representation of an ATM experience, allowing users to manage their accounts in a simulated environment.

In summary, this program models a simplified ATM system with predefined users, providing functionalities for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking in a user-friendly manner.
